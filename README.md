## First ML Project using modular coding principles

This is my first atempt at using modular coding principles to deploy an end to end machine learning algorithm.

The primary focus of this project was on applying Python modular coding principles, rather than on exploratory data analysis (EDA). As a result, I referenced the EDA analysis from Krish Naik's GitHub repository (https://github.com/krishnaik06/mlproject). Additionally, I utilized his YouTube videos to guide me in structuring my code to meet industry standards.
